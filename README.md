# Active ploughing through a compressible viscoelastic fluid: Unjamming and emergent nonreciprocity

Here we provide the main codes and data used in the work **Active ploughing through a compressible viscoelastic fluid: Unjamming and emergent nonreciprocity** ([arXiv link](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2109.10438)). These codes are written in FORTRAN90 language and tested in Linux. Commands to generate the ensembles using the codes were passed using shell scripting. Two MATLAB codes are provided for basic analysis and visuliation. Commands for running the codes related to each figures in the work are named likewise, e.g. commands for running the codes to generate Figure 2 of the manuscript is named as "Fig_2.sh". *Please note that we do not provide a full automated way to generate the figures of the work but provide the respective main codes with some examples*.
